# X-Team 43 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Tasks will be divided and assigned in equivalent workloads to ensure each person contributes something of value. 


## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Hold others responsible for their assigned tasks.  Update the group on where you are at on your own task. 


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If a person thinks their task needs to be reassigned or the workload re-evaluated, it is their responsiblity to let the group know what difficulties they are running into.  


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Hold others in the group responsible for their work and keep the group updated as you progress through your task, especially as deadlines get closer.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
